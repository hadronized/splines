//! The [`Interpolate`] trait and associated symbols.
//!
//! The [`Interpolate`] trait is the central concept of the crate. It enables a spline to be
//! sampled at by interpolating in between control points.
//!
//! In order for a type to be used in [`Spline<K, V>`], some properties must be met about the `K`
//! type must implementing several traits:
//!
//!   - [`One`], giving a neutral element for the multiplication monoid.
//!   - [`Additive`], making the type additive (i.e. one can add or subtract with it).
//!   - [`Linear`], unlocking linear combinations, required for interpolating.
//!   - [`Trigo`], a trait giving *π* and *cosine*, required for e.g. cosine interpolation.
//!
//! Feel free to have a look at current implementors for further help.
//!
//! > *Why doesn’t this crate use [num-traits] instead of
//! > defining its own traits?*
//!
//! The reason for this is quite simple: this crate provides a `no_std` support, which is not
//! currently available easily with [num-traits]. Also, if something changes in [num-traits] with
//! those traits, it would make this whole crate unstable.
