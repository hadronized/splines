//! Spline control points.
//!
//! A control point associates to a “sampling value” (a.k.a. time) a carriede value that can be
//! interpolated along the curve made by the control points.
//!
//! Splines constructed with this crate have the property that it’s possible to change the
//! interpolation mode on a key-based way, allowing you to implement and encode complex curves.
